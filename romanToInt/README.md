Solving a Roman Numeral to Integer conversion using Python. Add your Roman Numerals as keys to a dictionary where the integer equivalent is the values. Assuming the Roman Numeral sequence is passed as a string, you can easily traverse the string and take each character and use it as a key to get the integer value. Continue to add to the sum, intValue, until you have your conversion complete. Check if the numeral is less than the one after it, as that is a case of one of the conditions: 
    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 

    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
